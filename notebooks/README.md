## Python notebooks
The TopDownApp platform is designed modular, so that you can not only run the app in stand-alone mode, or the workflows on a cluster, but also work interactively on the results from an interactive python notebook. This folder contains notebooks illustrating TopDownApp re-use/development and (user-submitted) use-case studies.

You can view the contained notebooks on GitHub or open either in a local Jupyter instance or online on colab.
For example [here, to customise the spectra plots of the app](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mwalzer/TopDownApp/blob/main/notebooks/Plot_topdown_spectra_and_deconvolutions.ipynb).
